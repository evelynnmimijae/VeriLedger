# VeriLedger

VeriLedger is the very clever blockchain data storage and security choice for government agencies and health care providers. 

This repo shows the development of VeriLedger, including it's beginning stages in September 2024.

It's deployed on a Local Network. From there, I wrote and deployed a smart contract for a chain messenger tool, where you can communicate with team members and share searched findings. You can also use the communications tool to communicate with and search data stored on VeriLedger. 

VeriLedger is a hybrid strict and sequential consistency blockchain that ensures more data security than traditional blockchains, making it the very clever choice for blockchain data storage and management for government agencies and healthcare providers.
